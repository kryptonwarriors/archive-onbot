 ## Kypton Warriors | 16367

We are the Krypton Warriors from Parsippany, New Jersey consisting of 7 members. This is our first year of participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) competition. We participated in FLL for the past three years. We all came together as a team because of our love for science, and technology and we have similar interests.

## Coding
-   We use Vuforia for Skystone detection.

-   Scaling Logic is used to decrease joystick sensitivity on low speeds so that the drivers can better control the robot

-   We have a total of 9 programs each for RED and Blue side which allows us to come up with best strategy based on the strength of our alliance partner for each match

-   We use Visual Studio Code to build our OnBotJava code as it allows for very efficient code editing.
